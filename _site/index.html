<p>Welcome to our free one-day workshop for women studying and working in Computing in the Netherlands.
Join us, and participate to our poster contest on the topic of your choice.</p>

<p>Alice &amp; Eve 2021 is a workshop for celebrating women in computing in the Netherlands.
It aims to bring together talents in the field of computing.
The third edition of this workshop will be hosted on [TBA] by the Delft University of Technology.</p>

<p>Alice and Eve event is inspired by the <a href="https://bcswomenlovelace.bcs.org/">BCS Lovelace Colloquium</a> that started in 2008.
For more details about earlier editions of Alice &amp; Eve, see the websites of <a href="https://aliceandeve.cs.ru.nl/">2021</a> and <a href="https://fmt.ewi.utwente.nl/events/aliceandeve2020/">2020</a>.</p>

<h3 id="registration">Registration</h3>

<p>The event is free. We welcome everyone from bachelor students to full professors to participate and to attend the event.</p>

<p>If you would like to attend the workshop, please register here: [TBA]</p>

<h3 id="format">Format</h3>
<p>The event is held during a single day, and features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>keynote talks,</li>
  <li>a poster contest, and</li>
  <li>an exhibition on women in computing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exhibition">Exhibition</h2>

<p>In addition to the keynote talks and the posters, there will be an exhibition which portrays twenty women in computing and their most important contributions.</p>

<p>Some highlights of the exhibition:<br />
<strong>Grace Hopper</strong> who created the world’s first workable compiler;<br />
<strong>Ada Lovelace</strong> who is known for her work on the design of the ‘Analytics Machine’, the first ever general-purpose computer, and the first published algorithm;<br />
<strong>Rosalind Picard</strong> and her work on Affective Computing which is a combination of Computer Science, Psychology, Physiology and Cognitive Sciences;<br />
<strong>Frances Brazier</strong> who helped establish the first Internet Service Provider (ISP) in the Netherlands and Europe.</p>

<p>More information on these women, and many others, can be found at the exhibition.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All women students (Bachelor/Master/PhD) and postdocs of computing and related subjects [1] are invited to enter one of the poster contests during Alice &amp; Eve 2022.</p>

<p>To enter the poster contest, you will have to write a 250 word abstract on the topic of your poster.
Your abstract can be on any computing topic you like, e.g., it can be on a topic from social networking to quantum computing; and from medical image processing to formal verification. If it involves computers, we’re interested. If you aren’t sure what a 250-word abstract looks like, we have some example abstracts <a href="https://bcswomenlovelace.bcs.org/?page_id=94">here</a> (from the British BCS Lovelace Colloquium).</p>

<p>You will receive instructions about your poster with the acceptance notification e-mail.</p>

<p>[1] We interpret “related subjects” very broadly – we would like to involve everybody in the area of computing in the broadest sense. If you are not sure, drop the organizers an email and we will probably say yes.</p>
