<!-- ![Header Image, Alice and Eve 2022 at TU Delft](assets/header.png) -->


Welcome to our free one-day workshop for celebrating women studying and working in computing in the Netherlands!
Alice & Eve aims to bring together talents in the field of computing.
The third edition of this workshop will be hosted on **18 November 2022** by the Delft University of Technology.

Alice and Eve event is inspired by the [BCS Lovelace Colloquium](https://bcswomenlovelace.bcs.org/) that started in 2008.
For more details about earlier editions of Alice & Eve, see the websites of [2021](https://aliceandeve.cs.ru.nl/) and [2020](https://fmt.ewi.utwente.nl/events/aliceandeve2020/).

The event is held during a single day, and features:
- keynote talks,
- a poster contest, and
- an exhibition on women in computing.

Join us, and participate to our poster contest on the topic of your choice!

### Registration

The event is free. We welcome everyone (women, men, non-binary, any gender identity!) from bachelor students to full professors to participate and to attend the event.

If you would like to attend the workshop, please [register here](https://mondai.tudelftcampus.nl/en/event/alice-and-eve-celebrating-women-in-computing/).

## Exhibition

In addition to the keynote talks and the posters, there will be an exhibition which portrays thirty women in computing and their most important contributions.

Some highlights of the exhibition:  
- **Grace Hopper** who created the world’s first workable compiler;  
- **Ada Lovelace** who is known for her work on the design of the ‘Analytics Machine’, the first ever general-purpose computer, and the first published algorithm;  
- **Rosalind Picard** and her work on Affective Computing which is a combination of Computer Science, Psychology, Physiology and Cognitive Sciences;  
- **Frances Brazier** who helped establish the first Internet Service Provider (ISP) in the Netherlands and Europe.  

More information on these women, and many others, can be found at the exhibition and the [online booklet](https://fmt.ewi.utwente.nl/events/aliceandeve2020/booklet-13-01-2020.pdf).


## Call for Posters
    Deadline abstract: 24th of October 2022
    Selected abstract notification: 1st of November 2022

    Alice & Eve event: 18 November 2022

All women students (Bachelor/Master/PhD) and postdocs of computing and related subjects are invited to enter one of the poster contests during Alice & Eve 2022.  
We interpret “related subjects” very broadly – we would like to involve everybody in the area of computing in the broadest sense. If you are not sure, drop the organizers an email and we will probably say yes.

To enter the poster contest, please write a one page abstract (minimum 250 words) on the topic of your poster.
Your abstract can be on any computing topic you like, e.g., it can be on a topic from social networking to quantum computing; and from medical image processing to formal verification. If it involves computers, we’re interested.

Please submit your abstracts via [EasyChair (link TBA)]().  
You will receive instructions about your poster with the acceptance notification e-mail.

#### Poster Selection Committee
