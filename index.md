Welcome to our free one-day workshop for women studying and working in Computing in the Netherlands.
Join us, and participate to our poster contest on the topic of your choice.

Alice & Eve 2021 is a workshop for celebrating women in computing in the Netherlands.
It aims to bring together talents in the field of computing.
The third edition of this workshop will be hosted on [TBA] by the Delft University of Technology.

Alice and Eve event is inspired by the [BCS Lovelace Colloquium](https://bcswomenlovelace.bcs.org/) that started in 2008.
For more details about earlier editions of Alice & Eve, see the websites of [2021](https://aliceandeve.cs.ru.nl/) and [2020](https://fmt.ewi.utwente.nl/events/aliceandeve2020/).

### Registration

The event is free. We welcome everyone from bachelor students to full professors to participate and to attend the event.

If you would like to attend the workshop, please register here: [TBA]

### Format
The event is held during a single day, and features:
- keynote talks,
- a poster contest, and
- an exhibition on women in computing.


## Exhibition

In addition to the keynote talks and the posters, there will be an exhibition which portrays twenty women in computing and their most important contributions.

Some highlights of the exhibition:  
**Grace Hopper** who created the world’s first workable compiler;  
**Ada Lovelace** who is known for her work on the design of the ‘Analytics Machine’, the first ever general-purpose computer, and the first published algorithm;  
**Rosalind Picard** and her work on Affective Computing which is a combination of Computer Science, Psychology, Physiology and Cognitive Sciences;  
**Frances Brazier** who helped establish the first Internet Service Provider (ISP) in the Netherlands and Europe.  

More information on these women, and many others, can be found at the exhibition.


## Call for Posters
    Deadline abstract: TBA
    Selected abstract notification: TBA

    Alice & Eve event: TBA

All women students (Bachelor/Master/PhD) and postdocs of computing and related subjects [1] are invited to enter one of the poster contests during Alice & Eve 2022.

To enter the poster contest, you will have to write a 250 word abstract on the topic of your poster.
Your abstract can be on any computing topic you like, e.g., it can be on a topic from social networking to quantum computing; and from medical image processing to formal verification. If it involves computers, we’re interested. If you aren’t sure what a 250-word abstract looks like, we have some example abstracts [here](https://bcswomenlovelace.bcs.org/?page_id=94) (from the British BCS Lovelace Colloquium).

You will receive instructions about your poster with the acceptance notification e-mail.

[1] We interpret “related subjects” very broadly – we would like to involve everybody in the area of computing in the broadest sense. If you are not sure, drop the organizers an email and we will probably say yes.


#### Poster Selection Committee

The poster selection committee and jury consists of the following members: TBA

## Venue
