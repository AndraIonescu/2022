<p>Alice &amp; Eve workshop venue is located at Van der Valk Hotel Nijmegen-Lent, Hertog Eduardplein 4, 6663 AN Nijmegen. No matter where you are coming from, it is easy to get to Alice &amp; Eve by your own car, as well as public transportation.
Traveling by bus</p>

<p>Alice &amp; Eve workshop venue can be easily reached by bus with routes that pass Arnhem or Nijmegen Central Station. (bus company: https://www.breng.nl/en/).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>From Nijmegen Central Station, take either bus line 13 or 15 to Lent, Station Lent Laauwikstr.
From Arnhem Central Station, take bus lines 300, or 331 to the same station.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Alice &amp; Eve venue is situated in walking distance from this station.</p>

<p>When you enter the bus, check in at the OV chipkaart card reader located near the door. Once you leave the bus do not forget to checkout.</p>

<p>In case you don’t have an OV chipkaart, you can buy a single-use one (more information here). The single use OV chipkaart can be purchased from the ticket machines in the train station or in the bus. Since this type of card is topped up when you buy it, you can use it straight away to travel for one trip or 24 hours (unlimited travel for one day).</p>

<p>Note that you have to check in and out with the disposable chipkaart, otherwise it becomes invalid. Specifically, for traveling by train there is a NS Dutch Railways disposable ticket which carries a €1 surcharge over the standard fare. You also can charge your OV- chipkaart via several different methods, one of which is charging your card at a yellow loading dock located at any train station. There is a charging dock on campus as well, located in the hall of the Central Library. Please note that you need a Maestro debit card to use it.

Talk: Efficiency and agility: in secure hardware and in life!
When embedded electronic systems need high performance or low power consumption, it is often unavoidable to move computationally intensive or power-hungry operations, such as cryptographic algorithms, from software to hardware. In this presentation, we highlight research challenges and directions in the field of cryptographic hardware design with a specific focus on cryptographic agility, i.e. the ability of cryptographic implementations to be updated depending on newly detected vulnerabilities, new standards, or the availability of more efficient implementations. Finally, this talk will also give a personal reflection on efficiency and agility in life.

Christine van Vredendaal - System and Architecture Engineer at NXP Semiconductors
Christine van Vredendaal

Christine van Vredendaal was born on November 16th, 1989 in Breda. After completing the gymnasium at the Newman College in Breda, she enrolled in Eindhoven University of Technology in 2008 to study mathematics. During her time there she worked for the Public Relations team of the Mathematics and Computer Science department, served as Vice-chairman on the board of study association GEWIS and during her master thesis did an internship at Brightsight b.v. Her topic was Rank Estimation Methods in Side Channel Attacks. From June 2014 onwards she was a PhD Student in Dan Bernstein's Cryptographic Implementations group which work along side the Coding Theory and Cryptology group of the Mathematics and Computer Science department of the TU/e. She defended her thesis "Exploiting Mathematical Structures in Cryptography" with distinction in June 2018. Since August 2018 she has been working in the Innovation Center Crypto &amp; Security at NXP Semiconductors in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.

Talk: Post-quantum hash-based signatures
With the advent of a quantum computers, the cryptographic community is looking forward at post-quantum cryptography; cryptography that withstands a potential attack by quantum computers. Christine will in this talk first shortly introduce post-quantum cryptography. Then she will give some intuitions on one type of post-quantum cryptography: hash-based signatures. Why are they secure? How do they work on a high-level? What are their advantages and disadvantages compared to other post-quantum options?

Jasmina Omic - Product Manager Services at Riscure
Jasmina Omic

Jasmina Omic has worked in the security field for over 14 years. In her current position as Riscure Product Manager Services, she is driving the security services, relaying on innovative approaches and high quality standards. Jasmina focuses on providing the best services and guidance for Riscure customers, based on 8 years of hands-on experience as a security analyst for IC and embedded devices, working under different certification schemes and testing approaches.

Talk: On gender, change, attention, imposter syndrome &amp; technology
What kind of link exists between gender, imposter syndrome, change, attention, and technology? Let’s discover this together with Jasmina's personal journey through different fields of technology and science. We can start with electrical engineering (transistors and flip-flops), continue to discrete mathematics (eigen values, game theory and virus spread), and finally arrive at hacking chipsets with lasering the secret keys out.

Emma Gerritse - Ph.D. student at Radboud University
Emma Gerritse

Emma Gerritse has a Bachelor’s degree in both Mathematics and Computer Science, and a Master’s degree in Data Science. Her topic of research is the usage of Graph Embeddings in Information retrieval. She is interested in how we can use graph embeddings in the most optimal way to benefit users, but also the unintended effects they might have. Currently, she is a Ph.D. student at Radboud University Nijmegen.

Talk: Bias in Information Retrieval
Search engines are an important part in the daily life of people with internet access. Recently, with the power of modern techniques like Neural Networks, search engines have improved greatly in performance. However, these black-box methods can introduce all kinds of unforeseen biases, like gender bias. In this talk, Emma will give an overview of several methods used in Information Retrieval, discuss the biases they have introduced and methods how to mitigate this.

Gemma Catolino - Post-doctoral researcher at the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science
Gemma Catolino

Dr. Gemma Catolino is a postdoctoral researcher at the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science---a collaboration between Tilburg University and Eindhoven Technical University. In 2020, she received the European Ph.D. Degree from the University of Salerno (Italy). Her research interests include human factors in software maintenance and evolution, empirical software engineering, source code quality, and mining software repositories. She got recently receipted, together with other collaborators, of the 4TU Diversity-Equity-Inclusion grant. In addition, she serves and has served as a program/organizing committee member of various and high starred international conferences in the field of software engineering.

Talk: Exploiting Human-Factors in Software Maintenance and Evolution
During software development and maintenance, companies continually deal with issues related to the management of human resources. Such factors as team dynamics, experience, seniority, training, office culture could influence the success of a company and the quality of software produced. Hence, human factors should be carefully considered and monitored since they are an integral part of the software process and could lead to dangerous consequences. In this talk, Gemma will explain how she faced this problem by analyzing how human factors related to team's dynamics, e.g., culture, gender, reflect software quality from a maintenance perspective.

Thorsten Holz - Tenured faculty at the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, Germany

Prior to joining RUB in April 2010, he was a postdoctoral researcher in the Automation Systems Group at the Technical University of Vienna, Austria.

Talk: Reflections on Research
Life in academia can have many ups and downs: submissions to a scientific conference may be accepted or rejected, we may travel to conferences in distant countries or spend many hours in Zoom meetings, and experiments can work right off the bat or we may have to spend many months debugging a prototype. In this talk, I will reflect on the lessons I have learned in my 15+ years as scientist. I will dispel some myths about successful research and share some insights about how we do research in my group.
